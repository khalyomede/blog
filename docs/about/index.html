			<p>I am a web developer currently working at <a href="https://carlili.fr">Carlili</a>. I blog about my job and my passion, programing.</p>

<h2>My scholarship</h2>

<p>I started my IT journey with 1 year in a school teaching web development.</p>

<p>Then, I went to <a href="https://www.ynov-paris.com/">YNOV group</a> to finish with 2 years as an developer internship.</p>

<h2>My motivations</h2>

<p>Before starting my adventure as an IT student, I played a little bit with HTML. The idea to become a web developer did not started right after this experiment. This motivation has traveled a long way, starting by comparing the mobile development VS sysadmin VS web as the years go by as an IT student.</p>

<p>At some point, I had this conversation with my twin brother, when I told him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am convinced, in the future, everything will be web based. Mobile OS, cars, POS, everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this idea seems not that creazy, when we know <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/ft6bydt/">SpaceX has shiped Web Components in his Crew Dragon astronaut user interface</a>. The future is now...</p>

<p>At this end, what truely motivates me, is subjects like reducing our memory footprint and preserving the planet, help spending less time coding to care our friends and family, and having the best developer experience possible to be proud of what we do and help us scale better.</p>

<h2>My skills</h2>

<p>I have most of my experience of Laravel and Vue. I find these tools have a great user experience and they do the job without being too much on my way.</p>

<p>Most of the UI I work on are made with Bootstrap (3 &amp; 4), and I have some knowledge with SemanticUI, Spectre.css and recently Tailwindcss (which I like a lot!).</p>

<p>I use VSCode, Docker and obviously Git to develop my libraries as well as at my job.</p>

<p>I prefer Github over Gitlab and Bitbucket. However I have experience on both of them.</p>
